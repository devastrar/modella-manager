   cd modella-manager
   ```
2. **Set Up the Front-End**:
   - Navigate to the front-end directory:
     ```bash
     cd front-end
     ```
   - Install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```
   - Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example` and fill in your API keys and URLs, ensuring secure configuration as per user story 16.
   - Start the development server:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
3. **Set Up the Back-End**:
   - Navigate to the back-end directory:
