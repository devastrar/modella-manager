## Automated Testing Guide for Modella Manager

This guide walks you through setting up and executing automated tests for the Modella Manager application. It includes unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end (E2E) tests, performance tests, accessibility tests, and security checks, along with tools, commands, and best practices for each.

---

### 1. Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure the following tools are installed on your system:

- **Node.js** (v18+): For front-end development and testing.
- **npm** (v8+): Node package manager for installing front-end dependencies.
- **Python** (v3.9+): For back-end development and testing.
- **pip**: Python package manager for installing back-end dependencies.
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose**: For containerized testing (optional but recommended).
- **Git**: For version control and accessing the project repository.

---

### 2. Setting Up the Testing Environment

#### Front-End Setup
1. Navigate to the front-end directory:
   ```bash
   cd front-end
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

#### Back-End Setup
1. Navigate to the back-end directory:
   ```bash
   cd back-end
   ```
2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment for isolated Python dependencies:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

---

### 3. Unit Testing

Unit tests verify individual components and functions in isolation.

#### Front-End Unit Tests
- **Tools**: Jest + React Testing Library.
- **Purpose**: Test React components and utility functions.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- **Example Test Case** (for `ModelBrowser.js`):
  - Verify that the component renders model cards when provided with data.
  - Simulate a user typing in the search bar and check that the filtered results update correctly.

#### Back-End Unit Tests
- **Tool**: Pytest.
- **Purpose**: Test Flask API routes, business logic, and utility functions.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- **Example Test Case** (for `/api/models/<id>`):
  - Test that a valid model ID returns the expected JSON data.
  - Test that an invalid ID returns a 404 status code.

---

### 4. Integration Testing

Integration tests ensure that combined components and systems work together correctly.

#### Front-End Integration Tests
- **Tools**: Jest with Axios Mock Adapter.
- **Purpose**: Test interactions between React components and API calls.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
- **Example Test Case**:
  - Mock an API response for `/api/models` and verify that `ModelBrowser.js` renders the correct data.

#### Back-End Integration Tests
- **Tools**: Pytest with `unittest.mock`.
- **Purpose**: Test Flask API endpoints and database interactions.
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  pytest
  ```
- **Example Test Case**:
  - Test the `/api/download` endpoint to confirm it correctly triggers a Celery task for background processing.

---

### 5. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

E2E tests simulate real user interactions in a browser environment.

#### Tools
- **Cypress**: A powerful tool for browser-based testing.

#### Setup
1. Install Cypress:
   ```bash
   npm install cypress --save-dev
   ```
2. Start the application:
   - Front-end:
     ```bash
     npm start
     ```
   - Back-end (in a separate terminal):
     ```bash
     flask run
     ```

#### Running Tests
- **Interactive Mode** (opens Cypress UI):
  ```bash
  npx cypress open
  ```
- **Headless Mode** (runs in the background):
  ```bash
  npx cypress run
  ```
- **Example Test Scenarios**:
  - Navigate to the model browser, apply filters, and verify the displayed results.
  - Select a model version, initiate a download, and check for success confirmation.
  - Update user settings and confirm the changes are saved.

---

### 6. Performance Testing

Performance tests evaluate the application’s speed and scalability.

#### Front-End Performance
- **Tool**: Lighthouse (available in Chrome DevTools or as a CLI).
- **Command** (CLI):
  ```bash
  lighthouse http://localhost:3000 --view
  ```
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Page load times.
  - Responsiveness on different devices.
  - Accessibility scores.

#### Back-End Performance
- **Tool**: Locust.
- **Setup**:
  1. Install Locust:
     ```bash
     pip install locust
     ```
  2. Create a `locustfile.py` with test scenarios (e.g., simulate 100 users hitting `/api/search`).
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  locust -f locustfile.py
  ```
- **Focus Areas**:
  - API response times under varying loads.
  - Handling of concurrent download requests.

---

### 7. Accessibility Testing

Accessibility tests ensure the application is usable by people with disabilities.

- **Tool**: Axe Core (integrated with Cypress or as a browser extension).
- **Cypress Integration**:
  1. Install Axe Core:
     ```bash
     npm install @axe-core/cypress --save-dev
     ```
  2. Add to Cypress test files:
     ```javascript
     cy.injectAxe();
     cy.checkA11y();
     ```
- **Command**:
  ```bash
  npx cypress run
  ```
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Proper ARIA labels for screen readers.
  - Keyboard navigation support.
  - Sufficient color contrast.

---

### 8. Security Testing

Security tests identify vulnerabilities in the application.

- **Automated Tool**: OWASP ZAP.
- **Setup**:
  1. Download and install OWASP ZAP from its official site.
  2. Configure ZAP to proxy traffic from `http://localhost:3000` (front-end) and `http://localhost:5000` (back-end).
- **Running a Scan**:
  - Use ZAP’s “Quick Start” feature to scan both URLs.
- **Focus Areas**:
  - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
  - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).
  - SQL injection risks.

- **Dependency Scanning**:
  - Front-End:
    ```bash
    npm audit
    ```
  - Back-End:
    ```bash
    pip install pip-audit
    pip-audit
    ```

---

### 9. Continuous Integration (CI) Setup

Automate testing with a CI pipeline using GitHub Actions.

- **Configuration File**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
- **Pipeline Stages**:
  1. **Linting**:
     - Front-End:
       ```bash
       npm run lint
       ```
     - Back-End:
       ```bash
       flake8 .
       ```
  2. **Unit and Integration Tests**:
     - Front-End:
       ```bash
       npm test
       ```
     - Back-End:
       ```bash
       pytest
       ```
  3. **E2E Tests**:
     ```bash
     npx cypress run
     ```
  4. **Build**:
     - Front-End:
       ```bash
       docker build -t modella-frontend ./front-end
       ```
     - Back-End:
       ```bash
       docker build -t modella-backend ./back-end
       ```
  5. **Security Scans**:
     - Front-End:
       ```bash
       npm audit
       ```
     - Back-End:
       ```bash
       pip-audit
       ```

---

### 10. Running All Tests Locally

To verify everything works before committing changes:

1. **Front-End**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   npm test
   ```
2. **Back-End**:
   ```bash
   flake8 .
   pytest
   ```
3. **E2E Tests**:
   ```bash
   npx cypress run
   ```

---

### 11. Best Practices

- **Mock External APIs**: Use Mock Service Worker (MSW) for front-end tests and `unittest.mock` for back-end tests to avoid real API calls.
- **Use Test Data**: Maintain consistent test data (e.g., predefined models and users) for repeatable results.
- **Parallelize Tests**: Run tests in parallel in CI to reduce execution time (e.g., Jest’s `--runInBand` flag can be avoided).
- **Monitor Coverage**: Track test coverage with tools like Jest (`--coverage`) and Pytest (`pytest-cov`) to identify gaps.
