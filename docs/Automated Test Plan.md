Below is a detailed automated testing plan for the **Modella Manager** application, covering unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end (E2E) tests, performance testing, accessibility testing, and security checks. This plan ensures comprehensive coverage of the application’s front-end (React), back-end (Flask), asynchronous tasks (Celery), and external API integrations (Civitai and Hugging Face). It also includes a continuous integration (CI) setup to automate testing on code changes.

## Automated Testing Plan for Modella Manager

This plan outlines the testing strategy to ensure the reliability, performance, and security of the Modella Manager application. It incorporates multiple testing types, tools, and best practices to create a robust and maintainable testing suite.

---

### 1. Testing Types and Scope

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual components, functions, and modules in isolation.
- **Integration Tests**: Verify interactions between components, such as API calls and database operations.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Tests**: Simulate real user scenarios to ensure the entire system works as expected.
- **Performance Tests**: Assess the application’s ability to handle large datasets and concurrent operations.
- **Accessibility Tests**: Ensure the application meets accessibility standards.
- **Security Tests**: Automate checks for common vulnerabilities.

---

### 2. Front-End Testing (React)

#### Tools
- **Jest**: For unit and integration tests.
- **React Testing Library**: For testing component rendering and interactions.
- **Axios Mock Adapter**: To mock API calls.

#### Test Coverage
- **Component Rendering**: Ensure components render correctly with various props.
- **User Interactions**: Test clicks, inputs, and state changes (e.g., selecting models, initiating downloads).
- **API Interactions**: Mock API responses to test data fetching and error handling.
- **Internationalization**: Verify that translations load correctly and fallback to defaults.

#### Example Test Cases
- **`ModelBrowser.js`**:
  - Renders model cards correctly.
  - Handles pagination and infinite scrolling.
  - Displays loading states and error messages.
- **`DownloadQueue.js`**:
  - Shows progress bars for ongoing downloads.
  - Handles cancellation of downloads.
- **`Settings.js`**:
  - Validates API key inputs.
  - Persists settings correctly.

---

### 3. Back-End Testing (Flask)

#### Tools
- **Pytest**: For unit and integration tests.
- **unittest.mock**: To mock external dependencies (e.g., Celery, external APIs).
- **Factory Boy**: For creating test data.

#### Test Coverage
- **API Endpoints**: Test request handling, validation, and response formats.
- **Database Interactions**: Ensure CRUD operations work as expected.
- **Business Logic**: Test model management, download queuing, and disk usage calculations.
- **Celery Tasks**: Verify asynchronous tasks (e.g., model downloads) complete successfully.

#### Example Test Cases
- **`/api/models/<id>`**:
  - Returns model details for a valid ID.
  - Returns 404 for an invalid ID.
- **`/api/download`**:
  - Queues a download task correctly.
  - Handles invalid model IDs or missing parameters.
- **`tasks.py`**:
  - `download_model` task succeeds with valid inputs.
  - Retries on failure (e.g., network issues).

---

### 4. Integration Testing

- **Front-End and Back-End Integration**:
  - Test API calls from the front-end to ensure correct data flow.
  - Use **MSW (Mock Service Worker)** to mock back-end responses during front-end tests.
- **External API Integrations**:
  - Mock Civitai and Hugging Face API responses to test data fetching and error handling.
  - Ensure rate limit handling (e.g., 429 errors) is properly managed.

---

### 5. End-to-End (E2E) Testing

#### Tools
- **Cypress**: For simulating user interactions in a real browser.
- **Selenium**: Alternative for cross-browser testing.

#### Test Scenarios
- **Model Browsing**:
  - Search for a model and verify results.
  - Apply filters and sort options.
- **Model Details and Download**:
  - View model details and select versions.
  - Initiate and monitor downloads.
- **Settings Management**:
  - Update API keys and storage paths.
  - Verify changes persist and affect behavior.

#### Best Practices
- Use `cy.intercept()` in Cypress to mock API responses.
- Run E2E tests in a headless browser for CI.

---

### 6. Performance Testing

- **Front-End Performance**:
  - Use **Lighthouse** to audit performance metrics (e.g., load times, responsiveness).
- **Back-End Performance**:
  - Use **Locust** or **Apache JMeter** to simulate multiple users and test API load handling.
  - Focus on endpoints like `/api/search` and `/api/download`.
- **Database Performance**:
  - Test queries with large datasets to ensure efficient indexing and retrieval.

---

### 7. Accessibility Testing

- **Tools**:
  - **Axe Core**: Integrate with Cypress or use the browser extension for manual checks.
  - **Lighthouse**: Run accessibility audits.
- **Checks**:
  - Ensure ARIA labels are present and correct.
  - Verify keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.
  - Check color contrast and font sizes.

---

### 8. Security Testing

- **Automated Tools**:
  - **OWASP ZAP**: For detecting common vulnerabilities (e.g., XSS, CSRF).
  - **Snyk**: For dependency vulnerability scanning.
- **Manual Checks**:
  - Test for SQL injection by attempting malicious inputs.
  - Verify that sensitive data (e.g., API keys) are not exposed in responses.

---

### 9. Continuous Integration (CI) Setup

- **Platform**: GitHub Actions.
- **Pipeline Stages**:
  1. **Linting**: Run ESLint and Flake8.
  2. **Unit and Integration Tests**: Run front-end and back-end tests.
  3. **E2E Tests**: Run Cypress tests in a headless browser.
  4. **Build**: Build Docker images for front-end and back-end.
  5. **Security Scans**: Run dependency checks and basic security tests.
- **Triggers**: On pull requests and pushes to `main` and `develop` branches.

#### Example `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
```yaml
name: CI
on: [pull_request, push]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: '18'
      - run: npm install
      - run: npm run lint
      - run: npm test
      - name: Set up Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v2
        with:
          python-version: '3.9'
      - run: pip install -r back-end/requirements.txt
      - run: pytest back-end/tests
      - name: Run Cypress E2E Tests
        uses: cypress-io/github-action@v2
        with:
          start: npm start
          wait-on: 'http://localhost:3000'
```

---

### 10. Test Data and Mocking

- **Database**: Use an in-memory database (e.g., SQLite) for testing to avoid affecting production data.
- **API Mocking**: Use **MSW** for front-end API mocking and **unittest.mock** for back-end dependencies.
- **Sample Data**: Use consistent test data, such as a predefined `model_metadata.json`.

---

### 11. Reporting and Monitoring

- **Test Reports**: Generate JUnit-style reports for CI integration.
- **Code Coverage**: Use **Jest** and **Pytest-cov** to track coverage, aiming for at least 80% coverage.
- **Error Tracking**: Integrate **Sentry** for real-time error monitoring in production.

---

### 12. Testing Best Practices

- **Isolation**: Ensure tests are independent and can run in any order.
- **Speed**: Optimize test execution time to keep the CI pipeline efficient.
- **Flakiness**: Minimize flaky tests by avoiding timing issues and using proper waits in E2E tests.
- **Documentation**: Document complex test cases and maintain a test plan in the repository.
