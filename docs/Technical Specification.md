# Modella Manager Technical Specification

## 1. Project Overview

The **Modella Manager** is a web-based application designed to assist users—such as artists, researchers, and developers—in managing AI image generation models sourced from platforms like **Civitai** and **Hugging Face**. It provides an intuitive, secure, and efficient interface for browsing, downloading, organizing, and monitoring models, with features tailored for usability and global accessibility. Key capabilities include:

- **Model Management**: Search, download, and manage models from Civitai and Hugging Face.
- **User Experience**: Support for multiple languages (e.g., English, French, Spanish, German, Russian, Chinese, Japanese), customizable themes (light and dark modes), and responsive design.
- **Performance and Security**: Optimized for handling large datasets, concurrent downloads, and secure API key management.
- **Accessibility**: Compliance with WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines for inclusive use.

This specification reflects updates from user stories, source code analysis, and API integrations, ensuring a robust foundation for development and deployment.

## 2. System Architecture

The Modella Manager employs a **client-server architecture**, leveraging modern web technologies for scalability and performance:

### 2.1 Front-End
- **Framework**: React (v18.2.0) with Material-UI (v4.12.4) for a responsive, dark-themed default UI.
- **Features**:
  - Lazy loading (`react-lazy-load-image-component`) and infinite scrolling (`react-infinite-scroll-component`) for efficient model browsing.
  - Internationalization (`i18next`, `react-i18next`) with language detection based on browser settings.
  - Animations (`framer-motion`) and notifications (`react-toastify`) for enhanced user feedback.
- **Routing**: Managed via `react-router-dom` for seamless navigation across components (e.g., Dashboard, ModelBrowser, Settings).

### 2.2 Back-End
- **Framework**: Flask (Python) for RESTful API endpoints.
- **Asynchronous Tasks**: Celery with Redis as the message broker for handling model downloads and other background processes.
- **Database**: SQLite for caching model metadata and tracking downloaded models.
- **Security**: JWT authentication for API endpoints, HTTPS enforcement, and environment variable-based configuration.

### 2.3 Communication
- **Protocol**: RESTful APIs over HTTPS for secure front-end to back-end communication.
- **Data Format**: JSON for API payloads and responses.

### 2.4 Deployment
- **Platform**: Runpod, hosting both front-end and back-end.
- **Containerization**: Docker for consistent deployment environments.
- **Configuration**: Environment variables manage sensitive data (e.g., API keys) and settings.

### NOTE: Runpod's base nginx.conf already provides the WebUI proxy for Stable Diffusion Forge and the environment is single-user
